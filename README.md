# data-mesh

I'm learning how to implement a data mesh using docker and python.

### Why create a data mesh?

Imagine that I'm working with a movie and streaming platform, and they want to improve their recommendation system. However, the data could be utilized in a better way. Here's where the data mesh comes in.

### Potential users of the data mesh

- Team of data scientists/analysts who need a product for movies
- Team of data scientists/analysts who need a product for tv series
- Team of data scientists/analysts who need a product for users
- Team of data scientists/analysts who need a product for payment methods
